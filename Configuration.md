## Configuring the Controller

### Firmware settings
> The firmware settings is available for GRBL, TinyG and g2core

All your controller firmware settings are available in a configuration dialog and will let you tweak the inner workings of your hardware. It is available in both the UGS Classic and UGS Platform edition:
* UGS Classic - Open the menu `Settings → Firmware Settings`
* UGS Platform - Open the menu `Machine → Firmware Settings`

### Setup Wizard
> The setup wizard is currently only available in the UGS Platform edition and GRBL. 

Setting up your controller firmware configuration by hand can be challenging and may require a lot of _RTFM_. The **Setup Wizard** will help you set up your controller without the need to know how to create bitmasks and what features are dependant on another. 

To access it, open the menu `Machine ➞ Setup Wizard...`

These are the settings the setup wizard can help you with:
 * Import saved settings from file
 * Setup motor wiring to make sure motors run in the right direction
 * Calibrate your motor steps
 * Configure and test your limit switches
 * Configure and test homing
 * Configure the software limits creating a safe work area for your machine
