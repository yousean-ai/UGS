# Troubleshooting Overview

## Is the problem UGS, the controller, or CAM?

Many issues and requests for help are not actually specific to UGS, some of these are related to connecting to the controller, while others are CAM related.

UGS has three simple primary missions:
1. Take G-code from your computer and send it to your controller.
1. Send signals to your controller for setting up jobs. Examples: jogging and setting WCS manually.
1. Displaying and changing controller status. Examples: seeing alarm statuses and clearing them, toggling coolant, or adjusting speed+feed overrides, or pausing the program.

UGS does have additional secondary missions through plugins. Some of these are:
1. Dowel pin creation.
1. Probe wizard to automatically set WCS.
1. Workflow manager to help with tool changes between separate programs.

If your problem doesn't fit into the above, it may be that the problem is actually outside of UGS. The following table can help you figure out where to look:

| Description | Likely Components |
| --- | --- |
| Strange motion | Controller |
| WCS moves between restarts of controller | Controller |
| WCS moves between programs | CAM or Controller |
| [Unable to connect to controller](/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/wiki/Connecting-the-Controller) | Controller |

## UGS not starting properly?
If you have recently upgraded UGS and it has been a long time since the previous upgrade, sometimes the preference files need to be reset. Preferences are kept in a user directory called `.ugsplatform`, the path varies between the major operating systems:

| OS | Path |
| -- | -- |
| Windows | `C:\Users\`username`\AppData\Roaming\.ugsplatform` |
| Mac OS X | [TODO: find folder path] |
| Linux | `~/.ugsplatform` |

The folder will be hidden by default, so you will need to show hidden files in your file manager.
