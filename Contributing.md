If you are interested in contributing to make UGS even more awesome, there are many places you can pitch in.

Browse through the already reported [issues](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender) or check out the [discussion forum](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/discussions). You might know how to code, have ideas on how to improve the documentation or want to translate the software to your language.

### Code
Pull requests are welcome! Is there a feature you would like to see, or a bug that has been bothering you? Feel free to dig in. Not sure where to start? Ask here on github, use an existing ticket or create a new one.

If you're planning to make a lot of changes please create an issue to discuss implementation details. A lot of effort has gone into the current design so we want to make sure everything will to work together.


### Translations
We are currently using [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/2J2hB5I41Z) to manage localization. If you would like to help please consider signing up to contribute through this service.

To join the project sign up here: https://poeditor.com/join/project/2J2hB5I41Z

### Adding a new language
You can add a new language from POEditor and start translating.

If you want to stop here, create a ticket on GitHub and someone will update the project. To finish the job completely you'll need to know how to use [git](https://git-scm.com/).

* Create an empty property file for your language in ugs-core/src/resources.
* Open src/com/willwinder/universalgcodesender/i18n/AvailableLanguages.java
* Add your new translation to the availableLanguages object.
* Update the file in update_languages.py with a mapping between the POEditor key and your new file.
* Run update_languages.py, see README in scripts directory for configuration detail. Only commit the new file even if others were updated.
* [Create a GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
* Future language syncs will be done periodically with the update_languages.py script.
